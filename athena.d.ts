/* === Module: Archive (archive) === */
/**
 * Read zip, tar, tar.gz and gzip files, and gzip data in memory.
 *
 * Every format is a list of entries: a `.gz` file is a single-entry archive
 * named after the original file. `list`, `read` and `extractAll` work the
 * same way for all of them.
 *
 * Safety:
 * - extraction validates every entry before the first write: names with
 *   `..`, absolute paths or devices (`mc0:`), encrypted entries, existing
 *   files (with `overwrite: false`) and `maxSize` all reject the archive
 *   without writing anything;
 * - a file that fails midway is removed;
 * - `read` and `gunzip` stop at `maxSize` (default 16 MiB), so a small
 *   compressed file cannot exhaust the EE RAM.
 *
 * Failures throw with a stable `error.code` (see `ErrorCode`).
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * // Assets straight from a zip, without extracting to the memory card.
 * const pack = Archive.open("assets.zip");
 * const levelJson = Archive.read(pack, "levels/1.json");
 * Archive.close(pack);
 *
 * // Install with a progress bar; nothing is written if any entry is unsafe.
 * Archive.extract("update.tar.gz", "mass:/GAME", {
 *     overwrite: true,
 *     onProgress(entry, index, count) { drawBar(index / count); },
 * });
 *
 * // Compress a save in memory.
 * const packed = Archive.gzip(saveBytes, { level: 9 });
 * const restored = Archive.gunzip(packed);
 *
 * // Extract on a worker thread while the frame loop keeps drawing.
 * const job = Archive.extractAsync("dlc.zip", "mass:/GAME/dlc");
 * while (true) {
 *     const status = Archive.poll(job);
 *     if (status.state !== "running") break;
 *     drawBar(status.bytesDone / (status.bytesTotal || 1));
 *     Screen.flip();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Zip entries must use store or deflate (what nearly every tool writes);
 * other methods fail with `UNSUPPORTED` before anything is written.

/* === Module: Box2D (box2d) === */
/**
 * 2D rigid body physics with Box2D 3.2.
 *
 * A `World` owns `Body` objects; bodies carry `Shape`s (circle, box,
 * polygon, capsule, segment) and `Chain`s, and are connected by `Joint`s.
 * Units are meters, kilograms, seconds and radians; keep moving objects
 * between 0.1 and 10 meters and scale to pixels when drawing.
 *
 * Every Box2D object has exactly one script object: `shape.getBody() === body`,
 * and the shapes reported by queries and events can be compared with `===`
 * or used as Map keys. Objects hold their world (`body.world`), so the world
 * stays alive while any of them is reachable; an unreachable world is freed
 * by the GC with everything in it. `destroy()` frees the Box2D object at
 * once: later calls on it throw a TypeError (`isValid()` returns false).
 *
 * Invalid arguments throw instead of reaching Box2D, whose assertions would
 * reset the console: TypeError for wrong types or objects, RangeError for
 * values out of range (NaN and Infinity included). Every number must be
 * finite and within +-1e10; positions, points, distances and vectors
 * (`{ x, y }`) within +-100000 m (Box2D's B2_HUGE).
 *
 * Creating worlds, bodies, shapes, chains or joints, and `world.step()`,
 * throw a RangeError when Box2D would exceed `setMemoryLimit()` or leave less
 * than 256 KB of free RAM: Box2D itself cannot recover from a failed
 * allocation. A refused step leaves the world as it was. The limit goes back
 * to 0 (none) when the VM restarts (`std.reload()`).
 *
 * Performance: every getter allocates an object. To sync many sprites per
 * frame use `world.readTransforms(bodies, float32Array)` (no allocation) or
 * `world.getBodyEvents()` (moved bodies only).
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const world = Box2D.createWorld({ gravity: { x: 0, y: -10 } });
 *
 * const ground = world.createBody({ position: { x: 0, y: -1 } });
 * ground.createBoxShape({ halfWidth: 20, halfHeight: 1 });
 *
 * const crate = world.createBody({ type: Box2D.DYNAMIC_BODY, position: { x: 0, y: 5 } });
 * crate.createBoxShape({ halfWidth: 0.5, halfHeight: 0.5, friction: 0.4, enableContactEvents: true });
 *
 * while (true) {
 *     world.step(1 / 60, 4);
 *     for (const hit of world.getContactEvents().begin) {
 *         if (hit.shapeA.getBody() === crate || hit.shapeB.getBody() === crate) console.log("landed");
 *     }
 *     const t = crate.getTransform();

/**
 * 2D cameras, applied in C by every 2D draw: `Draw`, `Image`, `Font` and
 * `TileMap` go through the camera's transform before reaching the GS, so the
 * game draws in world coordinates and never subtracts the camera by hand.
 *
 * `Camera2D.main` is the current camera from the start. It shows the world
 * from (0, 0) at zoom 1, exactly like the screen, so nothing changes until
 * it moves. While `Loop.run()` runs, the current camera is updated after the
 * game's `update` and applied around its `draw`; `Camera2D.screenSpace()`
 * draws the HUD without it. Cameras use the scaled time of the Loop.
 *
 * A camera's position is the world point shown at its anchor (the center of
 * its viewport by default). Zoom is screen pixels per world unit, rotation is
 * in radians (clockwise on screen) and smoothing speeds are rates per second
 * (frame-rate independent: `1 - exp(-rate * dt)` of the distance each frame;
 * 0 means rigid).
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const cam = Camera2D.main;
 * cam.follow(player, { lerp: 8, deadzone: { w: 64, h: 32 }, lookahead: 40 });
 * cam.setBounds(0, 0, mapWidth, mapHeight);   // centered if the map is smaller
 * cam.zoom = 1.5;
 *
 * Loop.run({
 *     update(dt) { player.update(dt); if (hit) cam.shake(6, 0.3); },
 *     draw() {
 *         cam.draw(() => sky.draw(0, 0), { parallax: 0.3 });   // slower layer
 *         level.render(0, 0);                    // TileMap, in world space
 *         heroImage.draw(player.x, player.y);    // Image, in world space
 *         Camera2D.screenSpace(() => font.print(10, 10, `HP ${hp}`));
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * // Split screen: one camera per viewport, no current camera.
 * const left = new Camera2D.Camera({ viewport: { x: 0, y: 0, w: 320, h: 448 } });
 * const right = new Camera2D.Camera({ viewport: { x: 320, y: 0, w: 320, h: 448 } });
 * left.follow(p1); right.follow(p2);
 * Camera2D.setCurrent(null);
 * // in draw(): left.draw(drawWorld); right.draw(drawWorld);
 * ```
 *
 * Under a rotation, rectangles (images, glyphs, TileMap sprites) are drawn as
 * two triangles (TileMap sprites, on VU1, as triangle strips). While a camera
 * is applied, what lies entirely outside its viewport is skipped in C before
 * reaching the GS: images, rectangles, circles, each sprite of
 * `Image.drawList()`, whole texts, and the cells of `TileMap` grids.

/* === Module: Collision (collision) === */
/**
 * Light 2D collision and simple physics, in C. For platformers, top-down
 * games and shooters that want predictable, tile-friendly movement; Box2D
 * remains the choice for rigid bodies, joints and polygons.
 *
 * A `World` holds bodies (axis-aligned rectangles and circles) in a spatial
 * hash, and optionally a grid of tiles: solid tiles, one-way platforms and
 * floor slopes. Bodies move with a sweep along x, then along y: they slide
 * along walls, land on floors, walk up and down slopes and never tunnel
 * through thin walls, whatever their speed.
 *
 * Body types:
 * - `"static"` (default): moved only by you; blocks others.
 * - `"kinematic"`: moves through everything, by its velocity or when you
 *   set `x`/`y` (a tween, a path): moving platforms, elevators, doors. It
 *   carries the dynamic bodies standing on it and pushes those in its way;
 *   one caught against something solid is `crushed`.
 * - `"dynamic"`: gravity, damping, speed limits and velocity, blocked by
 *   what it collides with; bounces with `bounce`.
 *
 * A world steps itself with the Loop's scaled time before the game's
 * `update` (so `Loop.setTimeScale(0)` pauses it); pass `autoStep: false`
 * and call `world.step(dt)` to step it yourself. Any body can also be moved
 * with collisions by `world.move(body, dx, dy)`, like a character
 * controller.
 *
 * Positions are in world units with y pointing down: a rectangle is placed
 * by its top-left corner, a circle by its center. Velocities are in units
 * per second, gravity in units per second squared.
 *
 * Layers and masks are 32-bit flags: two bodies collide when each one's
 * `mask` has a bit of the other's `layer`. Read back, they are signed
 * integers, like the results of `|` and `<<`.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const SOLID = 1, PLAYER = 2, ENEMY = 4, COIN = 8;
 * const world = new Collision.World({ gravity: { x: 0, y: 900 } });
 * world.setGrid({
 *     columns: 40, rows: 15, tileWidth: 16, tileHeight: 16,
 *     tiles: levelIds,                        // the ids given to TileMap.setTiles()
 *     solid: [1, 2, 3], oneWay: [4], slopes: { 5: "45r", 6: "45l" },
 * });
 * const player = world.add({ type: "dynamic", x: 32, y: 32, w: 12, h: 24,
 *     layer: PLAYER, mask: SOLID | ENEMY | COIN });
 * const lift = world.add({ type: "kinematic", x: 200, y: 160, w: 48, h: 8 });
 * Tween.to(lift, { x: 320 }, 2, { yoyo: true, repeat: Infinity });   // carries the player
 * world.add({ x: 300, y: 100, r: 6, sensor: true, layer: COIN });
 * world.onEnter = (sensor, body) => { if (body === player) sensor.remove(); };
 *
 * Loop.run({
 *     update() {
 *         player.vx = pad.pressed(Gamepad.RIGHT) ? 120 : pad.pressed(Gamepad.LEFT) ? -120 : 0;
 *         if (pad.justPressed(Gamepad.CROSS) && player.onGround) player.vy = -330;
 *         player.dropThrough = pad.pressed(Gamepad.DOWN);   // fall through one-way platforms
 *     },
 *     draw() {
 *         hero.draw(player.centerX, player.bottom);        // a sprite with origin [0.5, 1]
 *         world.drawDebug();
 *     },
 * });

/**
 * Font loading and text rendering.

 * The constructor optionally accepts a path to either a TrueType file or a legacy
 * bitmap font (`.bmp`, `.png` or `.jpg`, optionally with a `.dat` width file).
 * With no path, the embedded Quicksand Regular font is used. Text is queued
 * into the current graphics command stream.
 *
 * TrueType glyphs are rasterized once at `size` pixels and cached; `scale`
 * stretches them, so prefer a matching `size` for large text. The same file
 * at the same size is loaded once and shared, and at most 16 different
 * TrueType fonts are loaded at a time: call `free()` on fonts no longer used.
 * Glyphs keep their proportions on NTSC, PAL, 480p and 16:9 modes, and follow
 * `Screen.setMode()`.
 *
 * A glyph is rasterized the first time it is printed, which can hold that
 * frame: `preload()` (or the `preload` option of `loadAsync`) does it ahead,
 * a few milliseconds per frame. Text printed every frame is cheaper through
 * `render()`, which lays it out once.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const title = new Font("fonts/title.ttf", { size: 48 });
 * title.outlineColor = Color.new(0, 0, 0);
 * title.outline = 2;
 * title.print(320, 40, "Game Over\nPress START");   // \n starts a new line

/**
 * Controller input for up to eight players, as a singleton.
 *
 * Supported controllers: DualShock 2 and other PS2 pads on both controller
 * ports, up to four per port through a multitap, and DualShock 3/4 over USB
 * (two) or Bluetooth (two, with a USB Bluetooth adapter).
 *
 * Only the two controller ports work out of the box. Multitap, USB and
 * Bluetooth each need an IOP driver that costs IOP memory, so they start
 * disabled; turn on the ones the program uses, preferably before the first
 * `update()`:
 * ```js
 * Gamepad.configure({ multitap: true, usb: true });
 * ```
 *
 * Players are logical: a controller that connects takes the lowest free
 * player and keeps it until it disconnects, whatever port or cable it uses.
 * Controllers already plugged in at start-up are assigned about half a
 * second after the first `update()`, in this order: port 1 slots A-D, port 2
 * slots A-D, USB, Bluetooth. Without multitaps, the pads on port 1 and port 2
 * therefore become players 0 and 1.
 *
 * Call `Gamepad.update()` once per frame. It polls every controller and
 * freezes a snapshot, so everything read from a `Player` during the frame is
 * cheap and consistent. `Gamepad.player(i)` always returns the same object.
 *
 * Analog values are normalized: sticks in [-1, 1], pressure and rumble
 * strength in [0, 1].
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const p1 = Gamepad.player(0);
 *
 * while (true) {
 *     Gamepad.update();
 *     if (p1.justDisconnected) pause();
 *     if (p1.justPressed(Gamepad.CROSS)) jump();
 *     const move = p1.leftStick();
 *     x += move.x * speed;
 *     if (hit) p1.rumble(0.8, 0, 200);
 *     Screen.flip();
 * }

 * if (!card.connected) throw new Error("Insert a memory card in slot 1");
 *
 * // Save: the directory is created on the first save.
 * MemoryCard.writeJSON("mc0:/MYGAME/save.json", state, { atomic: true });

 *
 * The module functions (`Random.int()`, `Random.float()`...) use a generator

 * `Random.seed()` makes it reproducible too. Non-finite numeric arguments
 * (NaN, Infinity) throw a RangeError.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const rng = new Random.Generator(1234);    // or a string: "level-3"
 * const die = rng.int(1, 6);
 * const loot = rng.pick(["sword", "shield", "potion"], [5, 3, 1]);
 * const team = rng.sample(players, 3);
 * rng.shuffle(deck);
 *
 * // Particles: one call instead of a loop of 500.
 * rng.fill(speeds, 40, 90);

 * Procedural noise computed in C, in single precision: Perlin and simplex in
 * 2D and 3D, Worley (cellular), and fractal sums of them (fBm, ridged,
 * billow), optionally domain-warped.
 *
 * The module functions use the script's noise (each script and worker has
 * its own), seed 0 until `Noise.seed()` changes it, so the same coordinates
 * always give the same value. A `Noise.Generator` is an independent noise
 * with the same methods: one per layer (height, moisture...) without
 * reseeding. For whole maps, `fill()` samples a grid into a `Float32Array`
 * in one call and `Noise.toTiles()` turns it into tile ids for
 * `TileMap.Instance.setTiles()`, without a per-cell loop in JavaScript.
 *
 * Determinism: the same seed gives the same noise on the same platform, but
 * not bit for bit between a PC and the PS2 (the EE rounds floats toward
 * zero), so a cell right on a `toTiles()` threshold can differ. Generate
 * maps on the console, or store them, when they must match exactly.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const W = 64, H = 64;
 * const height = new Noise.Generator("island-7");
 * const heights = height.fill(new Float32Array(W * H), W, H, { scale: 0.05 });
 *
 * const tiles = new Uint16Array(W * H);
 * Noise.toTiles(tiles, heights, [0.3, 0.5, 0.8], [WATER, SAND, GRASS, ROCK]);
 * map.setTiles(0, tiles);
 *
 * const wind = Noise.perlin2(time * 0.5, 0);  // smooth value in about [-1, 1]
 * const peaks = Noise.fbm2(x, y, { mode: "ridged", warp: 0.5 });

/**
 * Scenes and their assets.
 *
 * A scene is a screen of the game (title, level, pause menu): a class that
 * extends `Scene`, names the assets it needs in `static assets`, and gets
 * `enter`, `update`, `draw`, `pause`, `resume` and `exit` calls. The static
 * methods of `Scene` manage a stack of them:
 *
 * - `Scene.go(Level)` loads the level's assets in the background (while the
 *   current scene fades out, with `transition: "fade"`), exits the current
 *   scenes, releases what only they used, and enters the level;
 * - `Scene.push(Pause)` puts a scene over the current one, which pauses and
 *   keeps being drawn below; `Scene.pop({ result })` resumes it;
 * - a loading screen shows only when loading outlasts the transition.
 *
 * Assets are reference counted by kind and path: an asset two scenes use is
 * loaded once and survives going from one to the other (the next scene's
 * assets are acquired before the previous scene's are released). Images load
 * through an ImageList (decoded on a worker), sound effects, fonts and sprite
 * sheets through their background jobs, so frames keep coming while loading.
 *
 * Transitions and loading run on real time: a pause menu that sets
 * `Loop.setTimeScale(0)` can still go to another scene.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * class Level1 extends Scene {
 *     static root = "assets/level1";
 *     static assets = {
 *         images: { tiles: { path: "tiles.png", upload: "lock" } },
 *         sheets: { hero: "hero.json" },                 // Aseprite / TexturePacker
 *         sfx:    { jump: "jump.adp" },
 *         music:  { theme: { path: "level1.ogg", loop: true } },
 *         fonts:  { hud: { path: "hud.ttf", size: 20, preload: true } },
 *         data:   { map: "map.json" },
 *     };
 *     enter(assets) {
 *         this.hero = new Sprite.Instance(assets.sheets.hero, { clip: "idle" });
 *         assets.music.theme.play();
 *     }
 *     update(dt) {
 *         if (pad.justPressed(Gamepad.START)) Scene.push(PauseMenu);
 *     }
 *     draw() { this.hero.draw(this.x, this.y); }
 *     exit() { this.assets.music.theme.stop(); }
 * }
 *
 * Scene.run(Title);                                        // starts the Loop
 * // later, from a scene:
 * Scene.go(Level1, { transition: "fade", duration: 0.5 });

 * still accepted and loads them at boot instead.
 *
 * Streams:
 * - one plays at a time; `play()` on another stream replaces it (there is no
 *   crossfade: audsrv has a single stream voice);
 * - WAV (PCM 8/16/24/32-bit or 32-bit float) and Ogg Vorbis, mono or stereo,
 *   1 to 192 kHz. What audsrv cannot play as is (e.g. 16 kHz, 8-bit stereo,
 *   float) is converted on the EE while it plays; see `converted`;
 * - `pause()` keeps the position heard, so `play()` resumes exactly there;
 * - seeking, or switching to a stream of the same format, has no gap: the
 *   new audio follows the ~0.1 s audsrv already holds (other formats pause
 *   ~0.15 s while audsrv is reconfigured);
 * - `play`, `pause` and `stop` take `{ fade: ms }` for smooth fades;
 * - a reader thread decodes up to 0.5 s ahead, so slow storage (USB, disc)
 *   does not interrupt the music; the frame loop only has to keep calling
 *   `Screen.flip()` (or otherwise block) for audio to flow;
 * - `onEnd`/`onLoop` run inside `Sound.process()`; call it once per frame.
 *
 * Sound effects:
 * - `.adp` files with an APCM header, made with `make adp ADP_DIR=...` or `node tools/wav2adp.js`
 *   (or `adpenc`; `-L` for a looping sample). Files that would make the
 *   SPU2 play past their end are refused (`CORRUPT`);
 * - uploaded to SPU2 RAM (~2 MiB shared by every sample, see
 *   `getMemoryStats()`) and freed with `free()` or by the garbage collector;
 * - `loadSfxAsync()` reads the file on a worker thread, so a big sample
 *   does not stall the frame;
 * - after `IOP.reset()` a sample is uploaded again from its file the next
 *   time it plays.
 *
 * Failures throw with a stable `error.code` (see `ErrorCode`): `TypeError`
 * for wrong argument types, `RangeError` for values out of range,
 * `InternalError` for I/O, format or IOP failures.
 *
 * @example

/**
 * Spritesheets and animated sprites, advanced in C.
 *
 * A `Sheet` holds frames (rectangles of one texture) and named clips (frame
 * sequences with durations). An `Instance` plays a clip of a sheet and draws
 * its current frame in world space, through the current camera (Camera2D).
 * An `Animator` plays clips on a range of `TileMap` sprites, rewriting their
 * texture coordinates in C, so hundreds of animated sprites cost one
 * `render()` and no JavaScript per sprite.
 *
 * While `Loop.run()` runs, every playing instance and animator advances in C
 * by the Loop's scaled time before the game's `update` (so `setTimeScale`
 * pauses them); without the Loop, call `Sprite.update(dt)`. Events (frame
 * changes, loops, end) are dispatched after that pass, only to instances
 * with listeners.
 *
 * Frame durations are in milliseconds, as Aseprite writes them; `fps` sets
 * one duration for every frame. Rotation is in radians, clockwise on screen.
 *
 * Many instances draw fastest with `Sprite.drawAll(instances, positions)`:
 * one call, and one GS packet per 128 sprites of a texture instead of one
 * per sprite.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * const sheet = Sprite.Sheet.fromGrid(new Image("hero.png"), {
 *     frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 32,
 *     clips: {
 *         idle: { frames: "0-3", fps: 6 },

/**
 * Tweens: animate numeric properties of any object over time.
 *
 * Tweens advance by themselves while `Loop.run()` runs, before the game's
 * `update` and `draw` (a Loop system named `"tween"`, present while tweens
 * are active). They follow `Loop.setTimeScale()` unless `realTime` is set.
 * A tween reads the start values when it starts (after its delay), and its
 * last frame sets the exact end values.
 *
 * Tweens are awaitable: `await tween` resolves with `true` when it completes,
 * `false` when it is killed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const logo = { x: 320, y: -100, alpha: 0 };
 * async function intro() {   // no top-level await in this QuickJS
 *     await Tween.to(logo, { y: 120, alpha: 128 }, 0.6, { ease: "outBack" });
 *     Tween.to(logo, { y: 130 }, 0.8, { ease: "inOutSine", yoyo: true, repeat: Infinity });
 * }
 * intro();
 *
 * const tint = { color: Color.new(255, 255, 255) };
 * Tween.to(tint, { color: Color.new(255, 0, 0) }, 0.2, { colors: ["color"] });
 *
 * Loop.run(() => {
 *     image.color = tint.color;
 *     image.draw(logo.x, logo.y);
 * });
